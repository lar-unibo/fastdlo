### Abstract
In this paper, an approach for fast and accurate segmentation of Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs) named FASTDLO is presented. A deep convolutional neural network is employed for background segmentation, generating a binary mask that isolates DLOs in the image. Thereafter, the obtained mask is processed with a skeletonization algorithm and the intersections between different DLOs are solved with a similarity-based network. Apart from the usual pixel-wise color-mapped image, FASTDLO also describes each DLO instance with a sequence of 2D coordinates, enabling the possibility of modeling the DLO instances with splines curves, for example. Synthetically generated data are exploited for the training of the data-driven methods, avoiding expensive collection and annotations of real data. FASTDLO is experimentally compared against both a DLO-specific approach and general-purpose deep learning instance segmentation models, achieving better overall performances and a processing rate higher than 20 FPS.

### Installation

Main dependencies:

```
python (3.8)
pytorch (1.4.0)
opencv 
pillow 
scikit-image 
scipy 
shapely 
```

Installation (from inside the main project directory):
```
pip install .
```

### Models' weights

Download the [weights](https://mega.nz/file/YNsmnYwa#y9DiZEly-MQ_s8vHifSCDZLghaOe89pd4tZKQ5IOEME) and place them inside a ```weights``` folder.


### Usage

import as a standard python package with ```from fastdlo.core import Pipeline```.

Then initialize the class ``` p = Pipeline(checkpoint_siamese_network, checkpoint_segmentation_network) ```

the inference can be obtained with ```pred = p.run(source_img) ```.
